(c) sunilpaulmathew@xda-developers.com

What is F-zip about?
"F-zip is a universal shell script designed to make recovery flashable zip files with a few simple steps“

For those it is helpful?
Anyone (devs/newbies) who has something (boot.img/apps/libs/bootanimation/framework) to flash and do not want to do all the work to make a recovery zip manually

Where it works?
It will works on any Linux and Linux based operating systems including android. The Linux system might be native or with in a virtual box or even the bash inside Windows 10.

How-to-use?
1.	clone or download this repo into your Linux PC or Android device.
2.	copy "boot.img", if any, into the root folder. Caution: This feature is by default optimized for Samsung Galaxy S5 (kltexxx). Proper modification in the “fzip.sh” (line# 30) will be required for other devices. Don’t worry, you can easily find such details from any other working ROM/Kernel zip.
3.	copy the app folder(s) in to "/system/priv-app/" or/and "system/app/". You may also copy the “.apk” file(s) directly to “/system/app/” or/and “/system/priv-app/” (without folder) if your app/ROM supports to do so.
4.	copy library (typically “.so”) file(s), if any, into “/system/lib/”
5.	copy framework (typically “.jar”) file(s), if any, into “/system/framework/”
6.	copy framework-res.apk, if any, into “/system/framework/”
7.	copy bootanimation.zip (only for aosp ROMs) file, if any, into “/system/media/”
8.	modify fzip.sh accordingly (please see instructions)
9.	open terminal and cd to the root folder of f-zip
10.	run ". fzip.sh" (in Linux) or “sh fzip.sh” (in android).
11.	The recovery flashable zip file will be generated in the root folder
